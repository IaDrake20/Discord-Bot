# Discord-Bot
This bot is intended as a fun project to translate a user's input to binary or translate binary to english. More functions may be added in the future.

Update 1/11/2022
I have achieved this goal and have been kind of aimlessly adding stuff I think is cool to the bot, so as written below are my goals for this bot.

#1 Remove the command prefix "<<" from the binary translations
#2 (WIP)Add an image scraper to the bot with JSoup to find images desired by a user.
